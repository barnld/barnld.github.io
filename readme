Info:

- Building the site locally (when developing site):
    - Terminal (blog directory): "bundle exec jekyll serve" (test if works without "bundle exec"?)
    - Site is built and run on: "http://localhost:4000"
    - To force browser to refresh when source files are changed: "bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload"




Good to know:
- Markdown files are preferred to add simpler content (e.g. blog posts or pages). These are processed by Jekyll to generate HTML automatically.
        - Post .md files need to be in "_posts" folder
        - Standalone pages can also be created, in a custom folder or in root directory
        - Markdown syntax is completely compatible (so imo Obsidian notes could theoretically be used without any issues!)
    - HTML files can also be created manually for more "complex" content with more customizability if needed (+ .js integration).
- Structure of a blog post:
    - Mandatory naming: "YYYY-MM-DD-title.md" (e.g."2024-12-07-my-first-post.md") or "YYYY-MM-DD-title.html"
    - Front matter defines the YAML metadata that defines the post's properties (title, layout, date, categories & tags...)
- HTML file types:
    - a) Standalone (e.g. about.html, contact.html)
        - To be placed in the root Jekyll project directory
        - Accessible at e.g.: "http://my-site.com/about.html"
    - b) HTML Blog Post
        - To be placed in "_posts" folder
    - c) Custom Layout (reusable "template")
        - To be placed in "_layouts" folder -> can be used in other HTML or .markdown files with front matter's "layout:" property
    - d) Snippets/Partials (headers, footers, sections...)
        - To be placed in "_includes" folder -> can be used in layouts or pages using e.g. "{% include header.html %}"
    - e) Custom Assets (raw HTML, which doesn't need to be processed by Jekyll)
        - To be placed in "assets" folder (or in a static folder) -> can be linked directly using e.g. "<a href="/assets/example.html">View Example</a>"
- Data files are used commonly for storing navigation and other data
    - In Ruby ecosystem, yaml files are used most commonly
